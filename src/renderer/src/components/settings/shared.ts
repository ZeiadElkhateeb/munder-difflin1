export const webhookApiDoc = (godName: string): string => `Webhook API

Every webhook has its own URL, its own secret and its own mode. They share one
server and one tunnel; the id in the path says which one you are calling.

Trigger work (POST <tunnel>/<webhookId>):
  header  x-md-webhook-secret: <that webhook's secret>
  body    {"message": "do X for me", "title": "optional short title",
           "kind": "directive" (optional; it can only make a message stricter),
           "from": "who is calling"}
  -> 200  {"ok": true, "token": "<capability token>", "taskId": "<card id>"}
  -> 202  {"ok": true, "status": "awaiting approval"}

Check status (GET <tunnel>/<webhookId>):
  header  x-md-webhook-token: <token>     (or  ?token=<token>)
  -> 200  {"ok": true, "status": "todo|doing|blocked|done",
           "title": "...", "result": "<summary or null>"}

The mode decides which of the two answers you get:
  allow all           routes straight through -> 200
  communication only  plain questions route; anything else gets 202 awaiting approval
  strict              everything gets 202 awaiting approval

A 202 means the message is parked in Trigger History until you approve it; the
token you were handed still reads that task once it is routed. The secret
authorizes new work, the token only reads one task's status. Keep both private.

Each webhook checks bodies against its own JSON schema — edit that in the
Triggers tab of ${godName}'s Command Center.`;
